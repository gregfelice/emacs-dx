## Problem

**For**
- Developers serving in common coding roles
- and Elisp programmers who want to enable these developers

**Who**
- Like Emacs, have put the time in to read the GNU documentation
- Are seeking clarification on how to combine and use IDE-like features
- Often try to implement and combine various features with varying levels of success
- Find examples on the web that don’t work for them
- Want to utilize all Emacs has to offer, but feel they are missing guidance on how to do so

**Would potentially benefit from**
- Context on the Emacs strategy and roadmap for IDE-like features
- Guidance and examples on how and when to use IDE like features
- Communication from the team on where Emacs has been in the past, where it is now, and where it is going

## Ideas on Solution

- Talk to the Emacs development team for perspective on IDE-related feature set:
- Design choices the team is making
- Feature lifecycle: what is sunsetting, what is emerging
- Development roadmap in relation to team vision and fulfillment of popular specifications, like LSP
- Expectations of the core Emacs team, builder community, and users
- Clarification of what the Emacs development team’s scope - what is inside their responsibilities and control, and what they expect to see from a community

**Potential deliverables**
- A blog article, potentially in collaboration with respected community module builders
- A reference implementation using various features in combination
- A github project with “good practice” reference implementations for popular developer roles (python, reactjs)

**A good outcome**
- Will clarify open questions from the community
- Accelerate el module development
- Help new Emacs orient to the documentation faster, and get productive faster

**IDE-Like Feature Scope**
Not exhaustive. Functionally oriented, intentionally leaves out specific implementations
- At-point documentation
- On-the-fly diagnostic annotations
- Finding definitions and uses of identifiers
- Buffer navigation by name of function, class, method
- Enhanced completion of symbol at point
- Automatic reformatting of source code
- Completion candidates
- Snippet completion candidates
- Renaming symbols
- Automatically correcting problems
