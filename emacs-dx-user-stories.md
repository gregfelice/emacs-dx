We can detail specific tasks to perform here. Some examples:

- As a react.js developer, I can download a profile that integrates all my build tooling, various source code tooling, etc. knowing it will work out of the box
- As a react.js developer, I will not need to immediately know the differences and overlaps between jstx-module, web-module, etc. Choices will be made for me, and it will just work
- As a react.js developer, I can easily enable next.js support, tusting the react profile packagers understand the most popular react extensions and how to support them.

- As a full stack developer, I can configure two profiles side by side and know they harmonize, such as data science using spark, and react js.

- As a zsh user, the profile I download will give me a no-compromise zsh command line experience, with no confusion on environment variables, in Emacs shells vs outside shells, etc.

- As a developer, I want to configure my fonts to my tastes without breaking anything, so I can have an enjoyable coding experience day and night.

- As a developer, I want to eliminate any unused modules from my searches, so I can eliminate cognitive overload.

- As a developer, I want to ensure all the features defined in a language server spec like LSP are working, so I can gt down to coding.
- As a developer, I want to eliminate any guesswork from what modules are considered "current best practice", so I can get down to coding.
- As a developer, I want less "endless choice" and "extensibility", and more "usability" and "productivity", so I can get my job done. 
- As a developer, I expect Emacs to integrate into best practice code > build > test workflows for my tribe, like React. The Emacs tail should not wag the dog.
